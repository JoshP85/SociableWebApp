Final assignment for Cloud Computing at RMIT

**Summery**  
This project was focused on implementing an end-to-end cloud application using AWS cloud platform and technologies. We were free to use any programming language/framework and third-party API of our choice to develop our solution.  

I decided to create a lightweight social media website called 'Sociable' using c# and .net6 which allowed users to create an account, log in, add/remove/block other users, post content text/images, see/comment friends posts.
